Hi! This is NUSBuddyApp

This is an application that allows NUS students to gather information on courses and residences, and set reminders on deadlines in NUS! 

The inspiration for this application came as I thought about my own experience as a freshman in my school, where I struggled to find essential information regarding the courses and residences in NUS, due to the information not being on a centralised platform. I also struggled to find seniors to chat with to garner advice from, and found myself nearly forgetting many important deadlines. Hence, I decided to develop this application to help future incoming freshmen to NUS, have a smooth experience.

Feel free to look around, and do contact me if there are any queries.
